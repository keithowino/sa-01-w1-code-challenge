### Description

This was a code challenge comprised of 3 different tasks, the scripting of:-
  * A student grade generator
    * Which was about writing a program that prompts the user to input student marks, after which it calculates the correct grade to be issued to the student. 

      ```js
      const marksInput = parseInt(prompt("Input student marks? "));

      // marksInput = 50
      ``` 
      We prompt the user then we evaluate the entry

      ```js
      grader(marksInput);

      // students grade = C
      ```
  * A speed detector
    * Here i was to script a program that evaluates the speed of a car.
  * And a net salary calculator.
    * Here i was to script a program that calculates the net salary of an employee according to the guidlines issued while calculating NHIF, NSSF and PAYE.
